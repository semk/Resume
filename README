These directories present a CV template made with LaTeX.

cv-semk-xetex/		TeX sources, compile using xetex (recommended), requires 
			Adobe Garamond Pro font (best results). The target PDF
			files are already compiled for you if you don't have
			this font installed.
			
cv-semk-latex/		If you are unable to get the Adobe Garamond Pro font,
			then use latex to compile with the default cmr10 font.

Licensing: 		You are free to use this template for your CV, so long
			as you don't impersonate me :)
