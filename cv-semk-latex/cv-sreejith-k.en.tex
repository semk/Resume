  \citemnobullet Working as a Staff Engineer (Technical Lead) for the Cloud Mobility Services R\&D team at Nutanix, Inc.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Prototyped an agentless \& incremental migration methodololy for migrating Azure virtual machine workloads to on-premise AHV clusters.
  \item Boosted the migration throughput upto 7x on high latency, lossy networks by leveraging KCP, an opensource UDP based reliable transport protocol.
  \item Added protocol-agnostic stream multiplexing capabilities to the data transport pipe.
  \item Designed and developed the Nutanix Move microservice stack \& application life cycle management (one-click upgrade) using Docker container ecosystem.
  \item Built a minimal Docker container host operating system based on Alpine Linux to ship Nutanix Move as a virtual appliance.
  \item Designed and developed a rules engine to programmatically define and predict workload requirements for database migrations (DB Xtract).
  \item Developed a task execution framework in Python with support for pause/resume/cancel operations and progress monitoring.
  \item Lead the design and development FitCheck, a cluster health diagnostics tool.
